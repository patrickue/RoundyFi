See there is a folder name RoundyFi, inside this folder, there are various applications(Example codes):-
  * **Display Weather** -> Display the current weather via the "OpenWeatherMap" website, first of all, you need to make an account in OpenWeatherMap
    https://openweathermap.org/api and copy the API key and paste in the code,

  * **Make Server**  -> Make server using RoundyFi. 
    From this, we can communicate between server and client. for example, we make the mobile phone a client and RoundyFi as a server
