See there is a folder name RoundyFi, inside this folder, there are various applications:-
  * **Display Weather** -> Display the current weather via the "OpenWeatherMap" website, first of all, you need to make an account in OpenWeatherMap
    https://openweathermap.org/api and copy the API key and paste in the code, 
    Download the Arduino IDE https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
    There are also various libraries you need to install, we mention the libraries in a text file, which is inside the folder
